## How can I integrate DFX's IFRAME widget into my own website?

This is super easy, you just need the following code:

`<script defer="defer" src="https://dev.services.dfx.swiss/widget/v1.0"></script>

<div style="width:100%; max-width:450px; height:700px;box-shadow: 0px 0px 29px 0px white;">
   <dfx-services>Loading ...</dfx-services>
</div>`

If you have any questions, our moderators in the Telegram group or our support at support@dfx.swiss will be happy to help.
