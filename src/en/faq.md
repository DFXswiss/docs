## How can I integrate DFX's IFRAME widget into my own website?

This is super easy, you just need the following code:

``` 
<script defer="defer" src="https://services.dfx.swiss/widget/v1.0"></script>

<div style="width:100%; max-width:450px; height:700px;">
   <dfx-services>Loading ...</dfx-services>
</div>`
```

Note: Technically it is not an IFRAME but a web widget. This works much better than an IFRAME.  
If you have any questions, our moderators in the Telegram group https://t.me/DFXswiss_en or our support at support@dfx.swiss will be happy to help. 

## How can I "sell" Bitcoin in the DFX Wallet?

The sell function is unfortunately not yet built directly into the app itself, but we are working at full speed to build this in as well. Until then, selling is only possible via the MyDFX function. This works as follows:

1. click on "DFX Services" in the DFX Bitcoin Wallet.
2. now opens a website for buying bitcoin. Click on the menu icon at the top right and then on "My DFX". 3.
3. here you can now create a "Sell" route, for the sale of Bitcoin.
4. once this sell route is created, you will receive a Blockcahin deposit address. Every time you send bitcoin to this address, you will receive fiat paid out to your IBAN.
Copy the deposit address, go back to the DFX wallet and send the desired amount to this deposit address. Done.
6. you will be informed about the status of the sale by email.
